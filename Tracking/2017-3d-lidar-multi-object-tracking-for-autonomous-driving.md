> tracking-by-detection 모델(탐지와 추적이 연속적으로 이루어짐)


#### On the detection stage, 

segmentation of the raw data is done to build basic feature of the scanned objects and to distinguish between dynamic and static objects. 

Subsequently, the segmented objects pose is then estimated based on either its outlier feature or fitting the measurement into known model[28]. 

At this stage, the raw measurement has already been translated into refined measurement with meaningful attributes (e.g. the static/dynamic classification and the objects pose). 

In another word, the object is successfully detected. 


Subsequently, the detected object is given to state estimation filter so that object kinematic states can be predicted according to a dynamic motion model. 

The purpose of the tracker is to effectively estimate the possible evolution of the detected object states even in the presence of measurement uncertainties, an optimal Bayesian filter such as Kalman Filter and Particle Filter are extensively used to address state uncertainties due to unmodelled dynamics of target evolution or noise acting on measurement.



## 2. data association (DA)

Next, a data association (DA) procedure is done by assigning detected object into a track with established filter state or newly started trajectory. 

The purpose of DA is to ensure the detected objects are localized while simultaneously maintaining their unique identity. 

At this stage uncertainties of the measurement due to finite sensor resolution and/or detection step imperfection may arise 

In order to address this issue, Bayesian probabilistic approaches are commonly used to handle DA process
- Joint Probabilistic Data Association Filter (JPDAF)[29] 
- Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (MHT)[30].


## 3. 

Finally, in practice a track management is required to cancel out spurious track based on specific criteria. 

Track management is responsible for handling existence and classification uncertainties based on a sensor-specific heuristic threshold. 

For example, track existence is defined to be true if 90% of its trajectory of track hypothesis is associated with a highly correlated measurement. 

The same also applies with class uncertainties; object class can be determined based thresholding of dimension, past motion, or visual cue (i.e. colour). 

Alternatively, these two uncertainties can also be assumed to be a random variable evolving according to Markovian
process. 

The Integrated Probabilistic Data Association[31] specifically model the existence of track as binary Markov process.

## 추가 팁 

In a typical urban scenario, sensor occlusions are unavoidable occurrences, to address this several works try to explicitly model occlusion[32, 33, 34] during detection and incorporated occlusion handling in their object tracking method. 

In the inter-process level, one notable approach as proposed by Himmelsbach[25] is the bottom-up/top-down approach which lets the tracker and detector exchange stored geometrical information to refine the detection parameter.

Alternatively, some other works have proposed a track-before-detect method that avoids explicit detection that takes sensor raw data as an input for tracking process[35].

## 2. Detection Fundamentals

  

### 2.1 Overview

  

### 2.2 Spatial Data Acquisition using 3D LIDAR

  

### 2.3 Segmentation

  

포인트 클라우드는 데이터 양이 많기 때문에 의미 있는 그룹으로 묶어 주는 작업이 선행되어야 한다. ` A large amount of point clouds data demand a high computational power to process, in addition, due to discontinuous nature of point cloud, it is useful to combine the geometric points into a semantically meaningful group.`

따라서 탐지 작업 전에 전처리로 불필요한 부분을 제거 해야 한다. ` Therefore, the raw measurement needs to be pre-processed to eliminate unnecessary element and reduce the dimensionality of possible target object before it passed to the detection process. `

세그멘테인은 도로, 커브등과 같이 추적이 불 필요한 오브젝트와 차량, 보행자 같은 유니크한 물체로 구분시킨다. `The segmentation process mainly deals with differentiating non-trackable objects such as terrain and kerb from unique objects of interest such as cars, cyclists and pedestrians.`

추적 방법에 따른 세그멘테이션 기법 분류 ` Segmentation method can be divided into two groups based on the underlying tracking scheme[28]: the grid-based and the object-based. `

-  그리드 기반 : The grid-based segmentation is mainly used for **track-before-detect** scheme, and 
- 오브젝트 기반 : the object-based is used mostly for the **track-by-detect** scheme. 

혼합 형태도 있다. Although it is important to note the relation is not exclusive. For example, Himmelsbach et al.[25] used grid-based approach in the pre-processing stage (specifically clustering) but later used object-based approach to perform tracking.


#### A. Grid-based

이 방식은 특정 그리드에 물체가 존재 확률을 나타내는 **global occupancy grid maps**에 의지 하고 있다. `The grid cell-based methods chiefly rely on the global occupancy grid maps to indicate the probability of an object existing in a specific grid (i.e. occupied). `

가장 일반적인 존재 확률 갱신 방법은 **Bayesian Occupancy Filter**을 이용하여서 이전 프레임과 현 프레임의 존재 여부를 비교 하는 것이다. `One common approach to update the probabilities is to compare the occupancy in current time frame k with occupancy in time frame k − 1 with the Bayesian Occupancy Filter[74]. `

파티클 필터가 사용되어 셀의 속도도 추출 한 연구도 있다. `In some implementation, Particle Filter is also used in used derive velocity in each grid[75, 76]. `

The particles with positions and velocities in a particular cell represent its velocity distribution and occupancy likelihood.

이웃셀과 속도가 비슷하다면 클러스터링 된다. When the neighbouring cells with similar speeds are clustered, then each cluster can be represented in the form of an oriented cuboid. 

장점 : 그리드 기반 추적의 결과는  간단한 탐지 절차와 덜 복잡한 DA절차를 가진다. `Grid-based tracking results in simpler detection process and less complicated data association process,`

단점 
- 가려짐등으로 이동 물체를 탐지 하지 못하게 되면 해당 영역은 Static Grid로 간주 된다. ` however, the disadvantage of grid-based representations is if a moving object cannot be detected (e.g. due to occlusion), the area will be mapped as a static grid by default if no occlusion handling is applied. `

- 또한,  Additionally, grid-based representations contain a lot of irrelevant details such as unreachable free space areas and only have limited ability to represent dynamic objects[36]. 

그리드 기반 탐지는 자율주행에는 적합하지 않다. `The latter part suggests grid-based detection is insufficient for the purpose of urban autonomous vehicle perception which require detailed representation of dynamic objects to model the complex environment. `

따라서, 본 논문에서는 **track-by-detect**와 **object-based ** 기법에 좀더 초점을 두어 살펴 본다. `Therefore, we shall focus on the track-by-detect scheme, and the object-based detection will be explored more in-depth.`
  
#### B. Object-based

Point Model을 이용하여 물체를 표현한다. `Object based segmentation on the other hand, uses the point model (or rather collections of bounded points) to describe objects. `

이전 방식과 달리 **pose estimation**와 **tracking filter**를 필요로 한다. `Unlike grid-based method, a separate pose estimation and tracking filter are required to derive dynamic attributes of the segmented object. `

세그멘테이션 절차는 비-추적 물체를 분리하는 지표면 제거절차와 클러스터링을 거쳐 진행 된다. `The segmentation is chiefly done with ground extraction to separate non-trackable object with objects of interest, followed by clustering to reduce the dimensionality of tracked objects. `

The two steps will be discussed in the following subsections. 

Note that the step-wise results of object-based segmentation processes can be seen in Figure. 2-5.

##### 가. Ground Extraction

도면이 2차 평면이 아니기 때문에 포인트 클라우드는 장애물이 아닌 지면 정보도 포함 하고 있다. `Due to non-planar nature of roads, a point cloud coming from 3D Laser scanner also includes terrain information which is considered as non-obstacle (i.e. navigable) by the vehicle. `

운행 가능한 도면을 표시 해두는것은 중요 하다. `It is useful to semantically label the navigable terrain (hereby called ground) from the elevated point that might pose as an obstacle. `


지표면 제거는 Object Detection에서 중요한 절차 이다. `Ground extraction is an important preliminary process in object detection process. `

Lidar의 연산 부하는 무시 할수 없다. `As we are going to deal with a large number of raw LIDAR measurement, computation load must be factored during implementation. `

[77]에서는 도로 제거를 3분류 하였다. `Chen et al.[77]divide ground extraction process into three subgroups:`
- grid/cell-based methods, 
- line-based methods and 
- surface-based methods. 

[15]에서는 후자 2개를 scan-based method로 합쳤다. `Meanwhile, Rieken et al.[15] consider line-based and surface-based method as one big group called scan-based method. `

###### Grid-cell based method 
- divides the LIDAR data into **polar coordinate cells** and **channel**. 
- The method uses information of height and the radial distance between adjacent grid to deduct existence of obstacle when slope between cell cross certain threshold, i.e. slope-based method (see[12, 10]).

###### scan-based method 
- extracts a planar ground (i.e. flat world assumption) derived from specific criteria, 
- one of the approaches is to take the lowest z value and applying Random sample consensus (RANSAC) fitting to determine possible ground[78]. 


그리드 셀 기반 방식의 장점 : The advantage of grid cell-based method is that the ground contour is preserved and flat terrain is represented better. 

그리드 셀 기반 방식의 단점 : However, compared to the scan-based method it does not consider the value of neighbourhood channels, and thus may lead to inconsistency of elevation due to over-sensitivity to slope change. 

Ground measurement may also be incomplete due to occlusion by a large object.

하이드리브 방법 : `One notable approach which factored the occlusion is by Rieken et all.[14],`
- they combine of channel-wise ground classification with a grid-based representation of the ground height to cope with false spatial measurements and 
- also use inter-channel dependency to compensate for missing data.


  


##### 나. Clustering

포인트클라우는 연산 부하가 크다. `A large number of point clouds are computationally prohibitive if the detection and tracking are to be done over individual hits.` 

따라서 클러스터링 단계가 필요 하다. `Therefore, these massive point cloud is to be reduced into smaller clusters in which each of them is simply a combination of multiple, spatially close-range samples; the process is called clustering. `

클러스터링 방법론은 3가지로 나뉠수 있다. `Clustering can be either done in`
- 3D
- 2D (taking the top-view or XY plane) or 
- 2.5D[79] which retain some z-axis information such as elevation in occupancy grids.

###### 2D clustering

2D clustering offers computationally simpler operation. 

[80]에서 2D에 Connected Component클러스터링을 적용 하였다. [14]에서는 이를 3D에 적용 하였다. `Rubio et al.[80] presented a 2D clustering based on Connected Component Clustering which has shown to be implementable in real-time due to its low complexity, this method is also used in 3D object tracking method by Rieken et al.[14].`

일부 2D 추적 기법들도 사용 가능 하다. `Some literature in 2D object tracking[25, 45, 81] have shown that this approach is often sufficient in the application of object tracking. `

그러나 나무 밑에 있는 사람 처럼 중첩된 환경에서는 하나로 인식 하기에 조심 해야 한다. `However, care should be taken as vertically stacked objects (e.g. pedestrian under a tree) will be merged into one single cluster, which might be undesirable depending on the vehicle navigation strategy.`

###### 3D Clustering 

-3D clustering offers high fidelity object cluster that incorporates the vertical (z-axis) features.

Still, the resulting data and the computational effort required is some magnitude larger than its 2D counterpart. 

Compared to 2D clustering, there are fewer works which explicitly deal with 3D clustering for object tracking with LIDAR data. 

[63]에서는 RNN을 이용하였다. `Klasing et. al.[63] proposed a 3D clustering method based on Radially Bounded Nearest Neighbor (RNN), `

[82]에서는 DBSCAN을 이용하였다. `and more recently Hwang, et. al[82] using DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to employ full 3D clustering. `

실시간성을 만족 하기 위해서 2D, 2.5D 기법이 좀더 선호 된다. `Considering real-time requirement and significant number of points involved, 2 or 2.5D clustering is more preferred[83] owing to the fact vehicle onboard computer likely to have limited computational power.`

### 2.4 Pose Estimation

물체의 경로나 방향을 알기위해서는 [자세추정]이 진행 되어야 한다. `Subsequently, in order to extract usable information in term of the object trajectory and orientation, the pose estimation needs to be done. `

물체의 자세(pose)란 다음의 것들을 의미 한다. `Object pose is a broad term that may include the`
- dimension, 
- orientation (heading), 
- velocity and 
- acceleration of such objects. 

분류 `Pose estimation generally can be grouped into model-based or feature-based method. `
- 모델 기반 : 센서 수집값과 알고 있는 도형 모델 연결 `Model-based pose estimation aims to match raw measurement into a known geometric model, `
- 특징 기반 : 물체의 특징 정로보 추론 `while feature-based pose estimation deduces object shape from a sets of feature.`


#### A. Model-based

##### 가. 모양과 관련하여 

모델 기반 방식은 최적화 기법을 이용하여 반복하여 차량을 cuboid등에 맞춘다. `Model-based pose estimation uses optimization-based iteration to fit vehicle into cuboid or rectangle representation. `

The cuboid object is parametrized and the most probable vehicle pose from the segment points are iterated. 

In order to fit clusters of points into a model, edge-like features are to be extracted and "best-fit" method is utilised to fit it into a known model.


Barrois[84]
- A notable example is in Barrois[84] where the optimization problem is formulated as the minimization of the polar distance between the scene points obtained and the visible sides to compute the best vehicle pose.

Petrovskaya and Thurn[21]
- Petrovskaya and Thurn[21] use importance sampling scoring based on the fitting of measurement to a predetermined geometric model. 

Another interesting approach is by Morris et.al.[85] 
- whose matched filter takes view-dependent self-occlusion effects into account, 
- and utilise 4 rectangles to represent the inner and outer sides of the vehicle.

##### 나. 방향과 관련하여 

Another the major challenge in bounding box generation is the orientation estimation, 

일반적 방법은 : common approaches are by calculating the minimum area of clustered points[86], 

단점은, 가려진 부분이 있으면 성능이 않좋다. however in the presence of partial occlusion the results can be spurious in term of dimension and orientation accuracy, 

문제 해결 #1 : to tackle this problem Rieken, et al.[43] uses an L-, U- or I-like simple set of geometric classifier to derive most appropriate orientation. 

문제 해결 #2 : An alternative approach is to use convex-hull method to generate bounding box[87, 52]; the idea is to minimize the average distance between the
convex-hull points and fit a rectangle. (see Figure 2-6).



![](https://i.imgur.com/XcTXYMv.png)

Model-based pose estimation can also be combined with Bayesian probabilistic likelihood such as in the works of Vu and Aycard[88], Liu[64], and Nashashibi[89]. 

They explicitly modelled the possible occlusion area to estimate the vehicle dimension based on scan-line distance.

Liu[64] in particular uses "transitional region" between the inner-outer bounding box model object aiming to accommodate more measurement errors.


모델 기반의 단점은 
- 계산 시간이 큼 `Although model-based method offers optimal pose estimation, the major disadvantage of this method is the high computational time required, and this may not be suitable for realtime application. `
- 최적화 측면에서 Local Minima에 빠질 가능성이 있다. `Moreover, the optimisation problem may reach a solution at local minima depending on the initialization and results in a sub-optimal pose. `

그래서 특징 기반 방식이 선호 된다. `As a consequence, the feature-based pose estimation shall be preferred.`


#### B. Feature-based

edge특징을 이용하여 물체의 차원을 유추 할 수 있다. `Feature-based pose estimation, on the other hand, deduces the object dimension based on the edge features. `

For instance, 
- Darms et al.[90] extracted edge targets from raw measurement as a part of the box model to represent the vehicle’s pose. 
- Himmelsbach et. al.[25] used Random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to fit the dominant line of the segment points with the orientations of the objects. 
- Luo et al.[45] uses a graph-based method to fit clustered scans into an arbitrary shape, although this approach does not provide orientation information as is.
- Another approach, as done by Ye et. al.[91] is to extract a sequence of points facing the sensor with the smallest radius among the others in similar observation azimuth. 
    - then these points were fitted into L-shaped polyline using iteration endpoint algorithm. 
- Mertz et al.[92] use corner-fitting method to iterate through set of edge points to deduce the possible corner points.
- Similarly, Tay et al.[93] use edge filtering to deduce a bounding box vertex by iterating the edge lines to the nearest end point. (Refer to Figure 2-7)


![](https://i.imgur.com/9IX0xMy.png)


- 머신러닝 이용 : Machine-learning AdaBoost based detection methods can be found in the work of Zhang[94] et al., 
    - they use positive training samples obtained from multiple viewpoints of the object to train the detector to find 3D Harr-like features from clustered points. 
    - The trained detector is then used to generate a voxelized box for detection result. 

- 딥러닝 이용 : More recently, Braun, et. al.[95] utilises sensor-fusion approach using Regional Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) to estimate object orientation based on the joint proposal of stereo camera as well as LIDAR data

특징 기반 탐지 기법은 정확도-계산시간의 트레이드 오프 관계 이다. 일부에서는 불안정한 센서 측정값에 너무 민감하다는 우려도 있다. `Feature-based detection offers good trade-off between accurate pose estimation and computational time. However, Liu[28] also asserted that these approaches are notably sensitive to unstable measurement.`


### 챕터 요약 

To summarise this chapter, the 3D LIDAR sensor is selected due to its ability to acquire surround spatial information with feasible computational cost. 

However, occlusion-aware detection method has to be used to utilise the full potential of LIDAR. 

In addition, a real-time requirement calls for efficient methods. 

Therefore, based on these two criteria, the **Slope-based channel classification** and **2D Connected Component Clustering** are to be used for segmentation process with embedded height. 

Meanwhile, the pose estimation shall utilise minimum area rectangle augmented with L-shape fitting and cluster height information to form a 3D Box. 

Both methods have been shown to yield fast but reasonably accurate detection result under urban environment[96, 15], which in turn is essential for mission-critical urban MOT task.

## 3. Tracking Fundamentals

### 3.1 Overview

![](https://i.imgur.com/EW4cpdY.png)

1. The result of detection is used to start a new track, or if existing track exists, the measurement is checked
if it statistically likely to be correct measurement through gating. 

2. Passing the gating is the prerequisite of association between measurement and tracks before being sent forward to state
estimator. 

This chapter shall cover the assumed modelling of sensor and target dynamics, used not only in state estimatio and prediction, but also Data Association. 

Accordingly, several classes of Bayesian filter will be introduced.


### 3.2 Sensor and Target Modelling

The LIDAR sensor is placed on moving ego-car, which is considered as the origin. 

Due to the measuring principle of rotating LIDAR sensor the measurement originally comes in polar coordinates (in the form of distance and bearing). 

However, Velodyne digital processing unit readily provides the sensor measurement on the Cartesian coordinate system, 

In this thesis, the latter coordinate system will be used to conform better with ego-vehicle navigation frame. 

The relation between the ego-car navigation frame and sensor measurement frame can be seen in Figure 3-2.

### 3.3 Object Tracking as A Filtering Problem

In this thesis, object tracking problem is modelled as a filtering problem in which the object states are to be estimated from noisy, corrupted or otherwise false measurements. 

The estimated states and assumed system dynamics are given in the previous section. 

The basic concept of Bayes filtering is introduced along with the filters which will be used during implementation.


#### A. Bayes Theorem in Object Tracking


#### B. Unscented Kalman Filter

#### C. Interacting Multiple Mode


#### D. Data Association Filter

칼만필터가 예측값의 최적화를 지원 하긴 하지만 `KF (or its variant) offers the ability to provide optimal estimates of an object track. `

그럼에도불구하고  센싱의 불확실성으로 인해서 추적 물체가 해당 물체가 맞는지 보장 할수 없다. `Notwithstanding, due to measurement uncertainty there is no guarantee that the tracked object is actually a relevant object, or even if it is an existing object in the first place. `

따라서 후속적인 분류및 확인 절차가 필요 하다. `Therefore, a subsequent classification and validation of the estimated track are simply necessary.`

Data Association (DA) is a process of associating the detection result into a tracking filter.

There are two classes of DA filter: 
- the deterministic filter and 
- the probabilistic filter. 


##### 가. NNF

- Representative of deterministic DA filter is Nearest Neighborhood Filter (NNF) algorithm 

- NNF updates each object with the closest measurement relative to the state. 

- NNF associates object with known track based on the shortest Euclidean or the Mahalanobis distance between the
measurement and track.

##### 나. PDAF

- The probabilistic DA filter that is very well-known in object tracking literature body is the
eponymous Probabilistic Data Association Filter (PDAF)[29]. 

- The PDAF perform a weighted update of the object state using all association hypotheses in order to avoid hard, possibly erroneous association decisions commonly encountered in the use of NNF algorithm. 

- The erroneous association is often found during the scenario in which multiple measurements is located close to each other (i.e. clutter) and results in single measurement being used to incorrectly update all other nearby objects.


> PDA is also one of the most computationally efficient tracking algorithms among clutter-aware tracker[97], for
instance when compared to MHT[117].

## 4. MOT System Design and Implementation

### 4.1 Overview

챕터 구성 
- First, the system architecture will be given to give the reader a bird-view of the implementation.
- Subsequently, the development platform is presented to inform readers how the proposed framework is designed and implemented. 
- Finally, each of the building blocks in the system will be visited to investigate the individual underlying reasons and how the theory is implemented in practice.


### 4.2 System Architecture


주요 구성 요소 `The MOT framework is divided into two major components based on the functional objective:`
- (1) 탐지기: **Detector** which aims to produce meaningful, unambiguous segmented objects derived from raw LIDAR data and 
- (2) 추적기: **Tracker**, whose task is to assign and maintain dynamic attributes of detected objects across all time frame.



The component hierarchy and input-output flows can be seen in Figure 4-1. 

입력 : The input of the system is the raw data from 3D LIDAR scan in point cloud representation of environmental spatial data in Cartesian coordinate, 

출력 : while the output is a list of objects embedded with context aware attributes, namely the 
- bounding boxes, 
- trajectories and 
- static/dynamic classification.


탐지기 구성 3요소 `Detector consists of 3 sub-components which similarly, represent the subtask of detection process: `
- the ground removal, to eliminate object of non-interest and reduce dimensionality of raw data, 
- clustering, which segment the point clouds into collection of coherently grouped points (i.e. the object), and 
- bounding box fitting, which embed a uniform object dimension and general direction heading information to each cluster.

Tracker retrieves the list of bounding boxes and is responsible for keeping itself updated for the bounding box spatial and dimensional evolution on each time step change, handled by Position Tracker and Box Tracker sub-component, respectively. 

Note that the spatial evolution is expected to change according to motion model, while the box dimension should stays constant with changing heading. 

Both evolutions are perturbed by noise and uncertainties, therefore position tracker requires Bayesian filtering to reject the disturbance. 

Tracker also stores the output state of every track iteration in box history, in turn, the Box Tracker relies on past information from Box History to filter out noise before updating the bounding box.

다중 물체 추적(MOT)는 여러 구성 요소의 동작으로 작동한다. `The MOT tasks are largely sequential and inter-related, as each component relies on the output of preceding components to perform its task.`

To exploit this behaviour, the so-called bottom-up top-down approach[25] is used. 
- The Detector ("top" component) is to exchange information in a feedback-loop fashion with Tracker ("bottom" component) to reduce false detection. 
- Since track-by-detection paradigm is used, this approach also augments Tracker component task.

Each step on detection process is going to be presented in the following subsections. 

Note that the parameters of the detector used in implementations can be found in Appendix C.
